My earlier years of high school were uneventful,most of the interesting things happened later during middle school. <br>
Middle school is where I started getting into programming and games in general quite hard, taking an interest in Python and getting more serious about learning about game design.<br>
Iâ€™ve spent about half my life programming, participated in a few game jams and was enrolled on a robotics team for several years(our team won one year, 2708 in detroit) <br>
and am now trying to further my career and hobby by entering the professional space.
